What are your opinions on Agile software development?
- I think it's a very useful work philosophy if you have consistent client
or business-side feedback. In my experience, software developed in a vacuum can
be produced quickly, but there are significant risks that the end result
will diverge from the client wants or needs.

A two week development period can mean more time is spent communicating or
in meetings than coding, which can make coders grumpy. But it helps avoid
situations where the client realizes that the last X months of software
development are no longer what they need.

TDD or BDD?
- I am more accustomed to BDD, especially in situations where it is not feasible
to implement robust testing. For example, when adding a new attribute to an existing
model, it was preferred that I did not expand existing front end testing to cover
the form for that attribute. The reason being we were moving away from the platform
we used for frontend testing. In order to to use TDD, I would have had to implement
a new platform for frontend testing, which was not feasible.

TDD is the better practice, I think, for longterm stability and test coverage, but
it should be assumed that complex user behavior that can't be easily tested
should be accounted for when practicing TDD.

What are you looking for in a job?
- I am looking for a workplace that encourages progressional growth in
its developers. Ideally (and I understand this won't always be the case)
there will occasionally be time set aside to investigate new technologies,
work on personal projects, or mentor junior developers.

Are you legal to work in the US?
- Yes, I am a US citizen.

When can you start?
- Relatively shortly. I will be unable to commute until my family is entirely
vaccinated, but I can start working remotely as soon as I am set up.

Anything else we should know?
- I used RubyMine as a text editor at my last position and came to love
it! A part of me rebels against paying for a text editor, but it was
impossible to deny the efficiencies and productivity enhancement that
came from using a robust and professionally maintained editor.

- I should note here I was unable to finish the JS part of this application.
I'll admit that I don't have much experience working with raw javascript - virtually
all of the frontend work I did was in the context of the Angular framework.
Unfortunately some personal things came up, and I had shift my focus to
preparing for other interviews and other take-home assignments I received.
Apologies for the incomplete work.
