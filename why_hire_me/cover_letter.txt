Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm interested in joining your firm as a fullstack developer. I've worked
with Ruby on Rails on the backend, and a hybrid AngularJS/Angular 2+
frontend. While I'm interested in deepening my knowledge of these
technologies, I am happy to explore and learn new technologies - so long
as sufficient time and a bit of coaching is available to help me along the
way.

I'm looking for a long-term position where I can become a valued member
of a team, where I can contribute to the quality of the codebase and to the
culture of the engineering department. Eventually, I want to mentor and
onboard junior developers - I've had many mentors and senior developers
help me along the way, and I would like to 'pay it forward' someday.

Best,

Edward Graham
